It was from Damarla Venkatadri Nayaks domain, on 22 August 1639, the piece of land lying between the river Cooum almost at the point it enters the sea and another river known as the Egmore river was granted to East India Company after deed from Vijaynagara emperor.
            On this piece of waste land was founded Fort St. George, a fortified settlement of British merchants, factory workers, and other colonial settlers.
