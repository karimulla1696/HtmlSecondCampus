    <h2 style="text-align:center">History Of Hyderabad</h2><hr/>
    <p>Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that can be dated to 500 BCE.[2] The area around Hyderabad was ruled by the Mauryan Empire in the third century B.C during the reign of Ashoka the Great. After the death of Ashoka (232 BCE), as the Maurya Empire began to weaken and decline, the S훮tav훮hanas who started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, declared independence and established their empire in this region. The S훮tav훮hana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Kotilingala in Telangana as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered much of the Deccan plateau & central India for 450 years,i.e., from 230 BCE onward until around 220 CE. After the decline of the Satavahana Empire in 210 AD, the region came under the rule of the Ikshvaku dynasty (225 AD - 325 AD), the successors of the Satavahanas in eastern Deccan. The capital of Ikshvaku dynasty was the town of Nagarjunakonda in modern-day Guntur district and named after Nagarjuna, a southern Indian master of Mahayana Buddhism who lived in the 2nd century AD, who is believed to have been responsible for the Buddhist activity in the area..</p>
